## JavaScript Principles âš¡

Goes through the code line-by-line and runs/`executes` each line - known as the **thread of execution**.
<br />
Saves `data` like strings and arrays so we can use that data later - in its **memory**.
<br />
**Execution context**
Created to run the code of a function - has 2 parts (weâ€™ve already seen them!)
- Thread of execution
- Memory

**Call stack**
<br/>
- JavaScript keeps track of what function is currently running (whereâ€™s the thread of execution).
- Run a function - add to call stack
- Finish running the function - JS removes it from call stack
- Whatever is top of the call stack
- thatâ€™s the function weâ€™re currently running

### Introduction

[**Use Higher-Order Functions map, filter, or reduce to Solve a Complex Problem**](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/functional-programming/use-higher-order-functions-map-filter-or-reduce-to-solve-a-complex-problem)
#### Solution ðŸ¥³
```javascript
const squareList = arr => arr.filter(e => (e*10) % 10 === 0 && e > 0)
                             .map(e => e*e);
```

### JavaScript Principles

[**Apply Functional Programming to Convert Strings to URL Slugs**](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/functional-programming/apply-functional-programming-to-convert-strings-to-url-slugs)
#### Solution ðŸ¥³
```javascript
function urlSlug(title) {
  return title.toLowerCase()
              .split(" ")
              .filter(s => s.length > 0)
              .join("-");
}
```

### Functions & Callbacks

**Question 1**
<br />
Implement a JavaScript function called mapAsync that takes an array and a callback function. The function should map each element of the array to a new value using the callback function asynchronously.
<br />
The final result should be returned as a Promise.
#### Solution ðŸ¥³
```javascript

```

**Question 2**
<br />
Write a JavaScript function called sumRange that calculates the sum of all integers in a given range. The function should use recursion to handle the calculation and demonstrate understanding of the call stack.
#### Solution ðŸ¥³
```javascript

```
